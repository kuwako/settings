If the declaration is found, the file is opened at that positition.\n\nBy mistake I have published major version 2, and it didn't work to unpublished. So we have version 2:)\n\nI have moved non refactoring features in to package anca-misc.\n\nThere are two keymaps to run find-class. One with cmd and one with ctrl. I tried to use platform specific, it did even create these keymaps, but they didn't work. I don't know how to use this feature properly, and couldn't find any good documentation.\n\n![A screenshot of your package](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/69169/2290250/c35d867a-a017-11e3-86be-cd7c5bf3ff9b.gif)\n",
